### Description

*Real time network bandwith monitor *Animated analog/digital system tray icon speedometer *Database logging support *Crystal report functionality *Light weight *Massive update since previous ***It detects the currently available network traffic speed and displays an animated bar realtime bar graph both on the screen and in the system tray.

I used someone else's class modules to handle the network identification and just gave it an interface, I found that code here (csBandwidhMonitor). I am thankful to him/her.

Click on the application icon for menu. >>>> Download Crystal Reports ActiveX control from HTTP://www.BDSource.com/PrivateArea/Joy/Store/Crystl32.OCX (try using the URL in ur IE address bar in case of any trouble!) if you don't have it.    Mail me at Joy@BDSource.com in case of any difficulty.
